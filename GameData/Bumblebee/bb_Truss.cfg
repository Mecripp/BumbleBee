    description = Truss for mounting the Bumblebee contra-props to the core. Has variants for left or right side mounting. Place one on the right (starbord) side of the core, and place a prop on the front node, and another prop on the rear node, then mirror the rear prop (a button to do this is in the prop's part menu). Then pick up a duplicate of the truss with the props attached, and rotate twice with Q or E, place on the left (port) side of the core, and switch to the left side variant of the truss.
